# mpc-playlist-to-utf8

You can make playlists in Media Player Classic with UTF-8 filenames, but if you save the playlist MPC will do so incorrectly. MPC can, however, read playlists with UTF-8 filenames successfully. Normally you would have to hand tweak the playlist file manually, but this tool lets you automatically fix playlist files. It is imperfect right now: all the files in the playlist must be in a single directory.
